# TEAM 165

Go to [the team 165 website](https://c2team165.github.io/TEAM-165/)
 and select the Minecraft version you wish to get Forge for from the list.

You can download the installer for the *Recommended Build* or the
 *Latest build* there. Latest builds may have newer features but may be
 more unstable as a result. The installer will attempt to install Forge
 into your vanilla launcher environment, where you can then create a new
 profile using that version and play the game!
 
For support and questions, visit [the Support Forum](https://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/forum/18-support-bug-reports/).

[Here is a short video from Rorax showing how to install and setup Forge.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB3ArN_-3Oc)
